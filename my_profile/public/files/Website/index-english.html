        <p>Sado is an island in the Sea of Japan located in Niigata Prefecture and is the largest island in the Sea of Japan.
          It is an isolated large remote island located in the Sea of Japan, approximately 45 km west of Niigata City and 32 km shortest distance from the mainland, and the entire island is within the area of Sado City. With a total area of 855.34 square kilometers, it is the largest isolated island in Japan, with the Sado Mountains in the northern part of the island and the Kosado Mountains in the southern part, which parallel each other, forming the vast Kuninaka Plain between them, which is so vast that it is hard to believe it is an island.
          In June 2011, “Satoyama of Sado Island coexisting with crested ibis” was registered as a World Agricultural Heritage site, and in July 2024, “Sado Gold and Silver Mine” was registered as a World Cultural Heritage site.</p>

      <div class="textBox" id="history">
        <p>From excavated artifacts, it is known that Sado has been inhabited since 10,000 years ago. It appears in the myth of the creation of the country in “Kojiki”, the oldest history book in Japan, as the seventh of the eight large islands, and in the same myth in “Nihonshoki”, “Baikishu” and “Satoshu” appear as the fifth twin islands.

          Sado, which was already regarded as a country in the Nara period (710-794) and designated as a place of exile, was the home of many poets, including the Manyo poet Asaomi Hozumi, who criticized the imperial family in 722, Emperor Juntoku, who was defeated in the Jokyu Rebellion in 1221, Saint Nichiren, who criticized the Kamakura shogunate and other religions in 1271, Zeami, a great master of Noh drama, who drew the wrath of the shogun of the time in 1434, and many others Until the Middle Ages, aristocrats and intellectuals who were defeated in political disputes were swept away.
          
          As recorded in the Konjaku Monogatari-shu (A Collection of Ancient Tales) from the late Heian period, Sado had long been known as an island from which gold could be extracted. In the Edo period (1603-1867), Tokugawa Ieyasu, seeing the potential of the island, promoted full-scale development of gold and silver mines under direct shogunate control (tenryo), and the gold and silver mined there supported the Edo shogunate's finances.</p>

                  The Ibis Museum displays many materials on the protection, propagation, and reintroduction of the ibis to the wild.<br>
                  The Ibis Fureai Plaza is a popular spot where visitors can get up close and personal with the crested ibis kept in cages.<br>
                  A stroll through the park, where a monument honoring the last Japanese crested ibis “Kin” stands, is also recommended.<br>
                  The store's “edamame soft” made from Sado edamame is also popular.<br>

                <p>
                  In the “Historic Site Sado Gold Mine,” numerous remains that tell the story of the long history of the mine from the Edo period to the Meiji period and the cessation of operations in the Heisei period are everywhere, blending into the rich natural surroundings.<br>
                  Most of the mine shafts, mining facilities, and smelting facilities scattered across the vast site have been designated as national important cultural properties, historic sites, and industrial heritage of modernization.<br>
                  It is an extremely valuable heritage site that is unique in the world, where one can see almost all of the changes in mining technology and production systems over the 400 years of our ancestors' activities.<br>
                  The “Gold Mines of Sado Island” including this “Historic Site: Sado Gold Mine” has been recommended to UNESCO as a candidate for Japan's World Cultural Heritage in 2022, and preparations are currently underway for its registration.

                This hands-on museum stands on the site of the Nishimikawa gold mine, which is said to be the oldest on Sado Island.<br>
                The “gold dusting experience” is an easy challenge for anyone. The gold sand you collect can be processed into straps, pendants, etc. (for a fee).<br>
                It has an exhibition room where visitors can learn about the history of gold and a store selling original products such as confectionery and precious metals.

                Senkaku Bay is the collective name for five small bays that stretch along a 3-km stretch of coast from Himejin to Beitetsu.<br>
                It was named “Senkaku Bay” because of the beauty of its coastline, which is truly a counterpart to the East and West Seas, and is no less beautiful than Hardanger Bay in Norway, which has been called the best in the world.<br>
                In 1971, it was designated as an underwater park, and in 1996, it was selected as one of the 100 best beaches in Japan.
